## Database Backup & Restore

This is a simple app that shows how to perform backup and restore of a database. You can also upload it to Google Drive. 

The database is very simple and you can add students' information and the exams that they have passed. You can also visualize the two tables.

Please be aware tha you need to create to connect the Google Drive API in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/start/api?id=drive&credential=client_key). More information can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/android/auth#connecting_and_authorizing_the_google_drive_android_api)

This repo contains the code from the presentation: ["How to deal with backup & restore on Android](https://speakerdeck.com/prof18/how-to-deal-with-backup-and-restore-on-android-1) (The code is slighty different from the presentation)
